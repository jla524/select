Given the results of the previous queries, would it be fair to use this data
to claim that 2015 had the "hottest July on record"? Why or why not?

Fair enough, as query 8 claims that 2015 had the hottest average maximum
temperature in July. However, one may counter by pointing out the fact that
query 4 claims 2009 had the highest maximum temperature. So it really depends
on how the "hottest July on record" is defined.

Take a look at the article below. It claims that Vancouver had its hottest
summer in 2021. The claim was then supported by the mean daily average
temperatures. But since daily averages are not available in this dataset, the
average maximum is a good substitute.
